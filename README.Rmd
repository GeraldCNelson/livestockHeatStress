```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## GitHub Documents

This github project provides code used for the research reported in 
Thornton, P., Nelson, G., Mayberry, D. E., and Herrero, M. (2021). Increases in extreme heat stress in domesticated livestock species during the twenty-first century. Glob. Chang. Biol. doi:10.1111/gcb.15825.

The underlying data are available from the ISIMIP3b simulation round (https://www.isimip.org), at a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude–longitude.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
